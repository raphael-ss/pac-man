I am not the author of this game or it's specifications, i merely coded it. 

## How to Play

You must have in your directory a file called 'mapa.txt', which is the map you will be playing in. It must have the number of lines, columns, and maximum amount of plays until game over.

And after that, the map itself, containing the starting position of pac-man and all the ghosts you will play against.

You must inform the directory path for it to work.

All the plays will be read from standart input, in  the terminal.

As said before, check the PDF file for more information.
